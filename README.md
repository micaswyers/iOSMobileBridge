# iOSMobileBridge

This is a sample iOS application created during the MobileBridge iOS workshop
on 9/27/2015.

The app pulls film titles & synopses from RottenTomatoes and displays each in a
cell. Additionally, the movie poster image is pulled from Flixster to display
next to the above information.

That is all.
